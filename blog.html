                <h2>Adopted!</h2>
                <p>This photo is special because I found this spider on some leaves one day and many days after, I've seen it again and again. I watched this spider grow and gain more color and hairs on its legs. Like it's going through puberty *sniff*. It's also special because I actually have arachnophobia, so feelin this way toward a spider is unexpected, weird, and a blessing.</p>

                <h2>Favorite</h2>
                <p>This is one of my favorite photos that I've taken. Not to toot my own horn too, but I just really like it. I managed to capture the bee, standing on a flower, while getting the focus right, and everything just looks good. Yay bees!</p>

                <h2>Bug identified!</h2>
                <p>Since getting into photography with my macro lens, I've taken to walking around greenery and shrubbery, looking for critters. And it's fun! Which is especially good because I'm not a bug person. But while I like looking for and finding all these little bugs, I like to also know what I've had the pleasure of capturing. This one, I couldn't identify for a while, but I recently I saw a photo of the same kind of bug (same color too!). It's called a Cotton Stainer Bug!</p>
